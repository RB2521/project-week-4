Arduino Code for UoB, Dept EEE, Project week 4 - Modular display project

This is all versions of the code I have written for the fourth project week spanning 22/04/2024 - 26/04/2024.

NOTE - This code uses libraries declared at the top of the script. These are:
- WiFi.h
- HTTPClient.h
- SPI.h
- Arduino_JSON.h

NOTE - Running of Code

This code was desgined to run in conjunction with the Univerity of Baths Electrical Engineering Departments custom PCB provided to us. To run this on your own device, please ensure that you have checked the pins used to control the LEDs, as well as the input pin for the button.

NOTE - Arduino Version

The board used in this project is the Arduino Nano ESP32 with Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities. A different sized board could open more avenues for displaying more information

If you have any issues please email me at rb2521@bath.ac.uk and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Thanks!
